Marian benchmarks
=================

**Marian** is a C++ GPU-specific parallel automatic differentiation library
with operator overloading. It is the training framework used in the Marian
toolkit.

This repository contains scripts for benchmarking performance of the Marian
development repository: `https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev`.


## Structure

Directories:

* `benchmarks` - benchmarks
* `tools` - scripts and repositories
* `models` - models used in regression tests

Each benchmark is a set of self-contained scripts. See README files in
`benchmarks` subdirectories for more details.
